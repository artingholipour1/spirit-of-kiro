    story - A short paragraph about how I disassemble the item. Consider my skills and available tools.
            Think step by step about how to disassemble the item. If my tools don't allow me to disassemble
            the item then I will fail to disassemble. I may also fail or break parts if my skills are bad,
            or I do not have the appropriate tool.
    persona-improvements
    persona-improvements[].skill - A skill to approve
    persona-improvements[].improvement - Number between 1 and 100 representing how much success was had using the skill
    items - A list of components I have salvaged from the item. Attempt to break the item into up to five parts.
            Parts I am unable to remove should stay on the original item.
    items[].name - Name for the component. Microscopic components should be described in atomic or subatomic terms.
    items[].description - A description of the condition of the component, including details of damage.
                          Do not mention value or my skills. Prefer to refer to the item using "an" instead of "the"

    items[].icon - single word name for this
    items[].color - human readable
    items[].materials - array of material types
    items[].damage - short description of any damage to the component
    items[].equipmentSlots[] - An array of equipment slots this item can be equipped to, including effects when equipped.
                               Each entry should be an object with "slot" and "effects" properties. Valid slots are "head"
