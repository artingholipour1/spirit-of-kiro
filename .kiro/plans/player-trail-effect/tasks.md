  - [ ] 3.3. Add component to GameView
    - Import and add TrailEffect component to the game view
    - Pass required props like tileSize
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

  - [ ] 3.4. Write component tests
    - Test that particles render at correct positions
    - Test that particles have correct styling based on properties
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Integrate with Player Character
  - [ ] 4.1. Track player position changes
    - Add refs to store previous player position
    - Implement watch function to detect movement
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

  - [ ] 4.2. Generate particles on movement
    - Create particles at previous position when player moves
    - Add randomness to particle generation for visual appeal
    - Adjust particle density based on movement speed
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

  - [ ] 4.3. Respect trail effect enabled setting
    - Check if trail effect is enabled before creating particles
    - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

  - [ ] 4.4. Write integration tests
    - Test that particles are created when player moves
    - Test that particles are not created when effect is disabled
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1_

- [ ] 5. Add Settings Toggle
  - [ ] 5.1. Create settings UI component
