# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "Player Trail Effect" feature will enhance the visual feedback of player movement by adding ghostly sparkles that appear behind the player character as they move through the game world. These sparkle effects will fade away gradually over a period of two seconds, creating a visually appealing trail that follows the player's path. This feature aims to improve the game's visual aesthetics and provide players with clearer feedback about their movement and position in the game world.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Trail Generation

**User Story:** As a player, I want my character to leave behind ghostly sparkles as I move, so that I can see the path I've taken and enjoy enhanced visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player character moves THEN the system SHALL generate sparkle effects at the character's previous position
2. WHEN the player changes direction THEN the system SHALL continue to generate sparkle effects that follow the new path
3. WHEN the player stops moving THEN the system SHALL stop generating new sparkle effects
4. WHEN the player moves at different speeds THEN the system SHALL adjust the density of sparkle effects accordingly

### Requirement 2: Visual Appearance

**User Story:** As a player, I want the trail effects to have a ghostly, sparkly appearance, so that they match the game's aesthetic and are visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sparkle effects are generated THEN the system SHALL render them with a semi-transparent, particle-like appearance
2. WHEN sparkle effects are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they are visually distinct from other game elements
3. WHEN sparkle effects are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they do not obstruct or interfere with gameplay visibility
4. WHEN sparkle effects are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they match the game's overall visual style

### Requirement 3: Fade Effect

**User Story:** As a player, I want the trail sparkles to fade away gradually over time, so that the effect is temporary and doesn't clutter the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sparkle effect is created THEN the system SHALL begin a fade-out animation that lasts exactly two seconds
2. WHEN a sparkle effect is fading THEN the system SHALL gradually reduce its opacity until it becomes fully transparent
3. WHEN a sparkle effect reaches the end of its two-second lifespan THEN the system SHALL remove it from the game world
4. WHEN multiple sparkle effects are present THEN the system SHALL manage their individual fade timers independently

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a player, I want the trail effects to run smoothly without affecting game performance, so that my gameplay experience remains fluid and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sparkle effects are being generated and displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent frame rate
2. WHEN many sparkle effects are present simultaneously THEN the system SHALL limit their number to prevent performance issues
3. WHEN sparkle effects are no longer visible THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of them to free up resources
4. WHEN the game is running on lower-end devices THEN the system SHALL adjust the visual quality or quantity of sparkle effects to maintain performance

### Requirement 5: Customization Options

**User Story:** As a player, I want to be able to enable or disable the trail effect, so that I can customize my visual experience according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player accesses game settings THEN the system SHALL provide an option to toggle the trail effect on or off
2. WHEN the trail effect setting is changed THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the new setting without requiring a game restart
3. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL apply the previously saved trail effect preference
