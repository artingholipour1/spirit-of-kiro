## Kiro Demo Game

This is an infinite crafting game developed as a demo project for Kiro. >95% of the code has been written by prompting Kiro. This demo project is
designed to show best practices for Kiro, and AI engineering
in general.

## Resources

* [CHALLENGE.md](./docs/CHALLENGE.md) - This game has a sample branch that is deliberately left unfinished, with a few bugs. Read to learn more about these tasks. You can use Kiro to work on these tasks.
* [ROADMAP.md](./docs/ROADMAP.md) - There is always more ideas to build. Although this game has a basic core loop, there is a lot more depth that can be added. Kiro is a great tool to implement these remaining features.
* [architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) - Learn more about how the game works, and how it's pieces tie together.
* [appsec-overview.md](./docs/appsec-overview.md) - Similar to the architecture overview, but more focused on the inbound and outbound connection security.
* [local-deploy.md](./docs/local-deploy.md) - Instructions for how to deploy a local version of the game for fun, or for development
* [remote-deploy.md](./docs/remote-deploy.md) - Instructions for how to deploy the game as a publically hosted service on AWS infrastructure.

### Contributions

The core game loop of this demo project is complete, however, there is
also a roadmap of potential ideas that could be built into this game.
Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for ideas on what you might be
able to build into the game.
