# Kiro Demo Game Roadmap

## Player-to-Player Trading System
- Implement a basic player marketplace where users can list their crafted items for sale to other players

## Player Workbench Sharing
- If you have a great workbench full of powerful tools
  you should be able to grant other players access to the workbench in exchange for a fee. The secure workbench
  sharing feature allows guests to use your tools to craft on their own items.

## AI Shop System
- Expand the basic "item appraisal" system into a full shop. You should be able to walk through the door at the bottom
  to access your shop. Implement display cases for showcasing items for sale.
- Create an AI guest system that:
  - Generates diverse AI customers with different preferences
  - Enables natural conversation about items
  - Implements a haggling system with realistic price negotiations
  - Provides feedback on item quality and desirability

## Daily Crafting Contests
- Create a contest system with random daily themes. You
  submit a crafted item to the daily contest in exchange for rewards.
- Implement AI judging system that evaluates:
  - Theme adherence
  - Craftsmanship quality
  - Creativity and originality
  - Technical execution
- Develop a playoff system for top performers:
  - Weekly finals for top 100 players
  - Advanced AI judging criteria
  - Prize system for winners
- Add contest history and leaderboards
- Implement contest notifications and reminders

## Battle System

- Hire an AI champion, and equip them with your unique crafted
  items as armor or weapons.
- Dispatch your warrior to fight randomly generated AI monsters.
- Equipment will take real damage that needs to be repaired, and
  monster slaying will return interesting loot.
- Potential for PvP battles with other player's AI champions. Both players pick their champion's gear, and the AI simulates the battle results between both champions using the gear to the best of their abilities.
